Do you feel disappointed about Construct 2/3 ?
We have a good deal for you.

Do you remember the time of Construct Classic ?
Guess what, we're taking the best out of these 3 softwares and we are making it better !

## What is Xtruct?
Xtruct is an Electron-based game editor powered by phaser
and it will hopefully export to web, mobile and desktops.

## You're a developer
All you have to do is to grab your pants from the floor and step right in the development process to help us shape it

There is a lot of work to do to enable this engine to show its full potential, so we need you.

## You're a regular user
Feel free to ask questions, report bugs or even submit us your feature requests.
Also just saying *thanks* is very motivating. Don't forget to give us *a watch* üëÅ and *a star* ‚≠êÔ∏è
